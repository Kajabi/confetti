# Confetti

Confetti is a simple app to demonstrate the Kajabi Developer Platform.

The Kajabi Developer Platform allows third-parties to extend the functionality
of the core Kajabi product. Apps are granted access to Kajabi via OAuth, and they interact with Kajabi using a [RESTful API](https://kajabi-platform.stoplight.io/docs/developer-platform).

A [Kajabi Hero](https://kajabi.com/hero) can install apps to their
website using the CLI or the GUI interface in their site settings.

## Getting Started

You can explore how to set up apps using the samples in this repo.
Installation instructions for each language/platform are in their respective
directories.

You'll need a Kajabi site; if you don't have one, reach out to us at [developer-platform@kajabi.com](mailto:developer-platform@kajabi.com).

You'll also need to have the [Kajabi CLI](https://kajabi-platform.stoplight.io/docs/developer-platform/ZG9jOjQ3MjM3MTgy-the-kajabi-cli)
installed on your development machine to set up an app.

1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:Kajabi/confetti.git`
1. Copy `.sample_env` to your preferred platform's directory, e.g. `cp .env_sample ./go/.env`
1. Follow the installation instructions in the directory for your preferred language/framework.

## Adding Another Piece of Confetti to the Pile

If you'd like to add a new version of Confetti to the repo, create a new directory
with the following `README.md`. The newly-created directory should use the naming
convention `language_framework`.

```
# {{LANGUAGE OR FRAMEWORK}} Confetti

These instructions assume you've installed the [Kajabi CLI](https://kajabi-platform.stoplight.io/docs/developer-platform/branches/main/ZG9jOjQ3MjM3MTgy-the-kajabi-cli) and have a Kajabi account/site. (If you don't have a Kajabi account, reach out to us
at developer-platform@kajabi.com.)

1. Clone this Repository: `git clone git@github.com:Kajabi/confetti.git`
2. Change to this directory: `cd ./{{DIR}}`
3. Copy .env_sample to .env: `cp ../.env_sample .env`
4. Log in to the Kajabi CLI: `kajabi login`
5. Create a Kajabi app: `kajabi app create`
6. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into the .env file.  **This is the only time the Client Secret will be displayedâ€”be sure to save it!**
7. Run the app: `{{COMMAND TO RUN APP LOCALLY}}`
8. Install your new app: `kajabi app install`
```

### Confetti Specification

The Confetti app is granted access to the user's site with OAuth, and must implement
the endpoints below.

Your should provide helper functions to set up/run your application (assume a
Unix-like environment).

#### `GET /authorize`

When the app is installed via Kajabi's site settings or the CLI, this is the
endpoint that is called. The site's id will be apppended to the URL as a query
parameter.

This endpoint must create a valid OAuth request/URL and redirect to the auth provider.

The site's id must be included in the request.

When the user grants the app access, the auth provider will redirect to the following URL.

#### `GET /callback`

This endpoint validates the response, persists the token in a cookie/session, and redirects to the following URL.

#### `GET /sites/{site_id}`

If a request to this endpoint does not have a token present, redirect to `/authorize`.

The Confetti app is loaded onto the user's site with a script tag. The app's state
is stored as query parameters on the script's URL.

Check to see if there's already a script URL for this site, and use the values
from the query parameters as the initial values for the form.

If no URL exists yet for this site, use the following default values:

- `enabled` False
- `max` 80
- `size` 1
- `speed` 25

Render and return the form in `edit.html` with the values.

#### `POST /sites/{site_id}`

If a request to this endpoint does not have a token present, redirect to `/authorize`.

The following form data must be posted to this endpoint:

- `enabled` boolean
- `max` integer
- `size` integer
- `speed` integer

Create or update the script URL for this site with the provided values as
query parameters.

Render and return the form in `edit.html` with the new values.
